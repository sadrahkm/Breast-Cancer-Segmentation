# Project Description

• Implemented a U-Net model for detection and segmentation of breast cancer using breast ultrasound images

# Other Projects

**Covid-19 detection using chest X-ray images** [(Link)](https://github.com/sadrahkm/Pneumonia-detection)

• After preprocessing the X-ray images, a VGG16 model was utilized to classify the Covid-19 images


**Heart Attack Analysis & Prediction** [(Link)](https://github.com/sadrahkm/ML-Projects)

• Performed EDA and applied classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, and SVM to detect if a person is prone to a heart attack

**Mall Customer Segmentation** [(Link)](https://github.com/sadrahkm/ML-Projects)

• After preprocessing the data, clustering algorithms such as K-Means and Agglomerative were utilized for customer segmentation
